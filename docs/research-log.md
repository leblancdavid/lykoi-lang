## R5.45 bounded verification and incomplete state closure (2026-10-04)

Observed **`R5_45_STATE_IDENTITY_GAP`**. R5.43's preserved 118.187-second full
harness plus the requested focused/application suites estimates 123.923 seconds
of suite work for R5.44, before other gates. Its exact timeout position remains
unknown because buffered output and absent stage receipts cannot establish it.
No R5.44 verification retry occurred.

R5.45 independently completes 72 bounded investigation stages in three batches.
Supervised subprocesses total 145.682 seconds; the slowest costs 12.667 seconds,
with no single dominating stage. Full restricted union: 429 discovered / 393 pass /
36 retained skips. Application/compiler 31, R5.41 focused 14, recorder 29 and new
synthetic certificate tests 33 pass. Matrix reproduces twice at 16 profiles/84
rows; model/safety/schema/99-leaf traceability/contamination pass. Historical 678,
prospective 695 and infrastructure 731 byte locks remain valid.

The synthetic certificate rejects mixed/stale/missing/failed/incomplete or mutated
evidence, wrong mechanisms/versions/count/authority, and post-certificate mutation;
one synthetic callback succeeds and a second is prevented. Timeout evidence stays
INCOMPLETE across separate recomputation. These are closed-fixture observations,
not qualification of the actual future experimental state.

Inspection identifies omitted Git, external runtime and effective-environment
inputs in the investigation snapshot. Stop qualification; no production certificate
or real-stage reuse. Reporting changes do not retroactively refresh prior evidence.
Zero B02 exposure/support/generation/execution/acceptance; core 30, B03 prospectively
untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, Phase 5C paused. R5.42/R5.44 halts are preserved;
R5.43 remains latest qualified infrastructure. Next: separately authorized complete
execution-input identity qualification. See [report](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_45-PREEXPOSURE-VERIFICATION-RELIABILITY-AND-BOUNDED-EXECUTION.md)
and the prospective-only [protocol](preexposure-r5.45.md).

## R5.44 pre-exposure verification interruption (2026-10-04)

Observed **`R5_44_PROTOCOL_HALT`** before B02 exposure. The newly authorized
static-transfer experiment's prepass was terminated at the 120000-ms shell-tool
limit. Captured stdout was `True` and `Axiom validate: ok`; no prepass, experimental
seal, reservation or observation receipt was produced. Completed regression
counts and fresh matrix/structural/traceability verification were not established.
No gate retry or B02 evaluation followed. This does not identify a B02 capability,
configuration, coherence or new-semantic gap.

Stopped-run integrity verifies 678 historical, 695 prospective and 731
infrastructure protected files unchanged, identities valid; historical lock HEAD
ancestry valid. Frozen B02 authority hashes remain unchanged, contamination is
clean. The unchanged qualified R5.43 recorder seals halt-accounting evidence and
records HALT with zero reservations/observations, distinctly from an experimental
starting seal. Its recorded evidence blocks further dispatch in this experiment.

Core remains 30/no #31; zero repair, B02 generation/execution/frozen acceptance.
B03 prospectively untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, Phase 5C paused. R5.43
qualification and R5.42 permanent halt remain intact. Recommend a separately
authorized investigation of the verification interruption before any new locked
transfer evaluation. Evidence: [R5.44 report](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_44-NEWLY-AUTHORIZED-LOCKED-WHOLE-CONTRACT-STATIC-SUPPORT-TRANSFER.md),
`R5_44-halt-verification.json`, `R5_44-classification.json`, `R5_44-recorder/` and
`R5_44-final-integrity.json` beside the report.

## R5.43 canonical-evidence infrastructure qualification (2026-10-04)

Observed **`R5_43_EVALUATION_INFRASTRUCTURE_QUALIFIED`** on independent synthetic
evidence through a separately versioned production recorder. The R5.42 tuple/list
false mismatch is reproduced; canonical equivalence succeeds while raw Python
equality fails. Adversarial value/field/type/version/sequence/provenance changes
reject. Strict loading rejects corruption; canonical bytes detach baseline
authority from mutable working objects. Ten repeated canonical serializations,
two recorded focused suites and two independent matrix reconstructions agree.

Production-path locked simulations: success records one observation and STOP;
pre-pass mismatch records zero and HALT; post-observation mismatch records one
and HALT; a second attempted callback is blocked. Multiple receipts are detected.
An incomplete callback is indeterminate, halts and cannot retry. These observations
qualify the local controlled dispatch path, not crash exactly-once completion,
malicious authority rewriting or evaluator calls outside the recorder.

Verification: 29 new tests pass repeatedly; 429 harness discovered / 393 passed /
36 prohibited-B02 skips; 31/31 application/compiler; 14/14 R5.41 focused; 16
coherent profiles / 84 rows; canonical matrix SHA-256 remains
`02e3c3723a74d16458114760c0c917afbc7597e3ad76c62553014a475471513c`.
Validation/safety and independent structural/source-traceability/contamination
checks pass. Historical 678, prospective 695 and infrastructure 731 byte locks
pass; R5.42 recorder/halt artifacts remain intact. Final diff check and any
line-ending advisories are captured separately in final integrity evidence.

Zero B02 exposure/static support/generation/execution/acceptance; no B02
readiness/audit/admission finding. Core remains 30; no semantic/profile/application
repair. B03 prospectively untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, Phase 5C paused.
R5.42 permanently remains `R5_42_PROTOCOL_HALT`. Recommend a newly authorized
locked whole-contract static transfer evaluation; it has not begun.
Evidence: [R5.43 report](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_43-EVALUATION-INFRASTRUCTURE-CANONICAL-EVIDENCE-QUALIFICATION.md),
`R5_43-qualification.json` and `R5_43-simulations/` beside it;
[protocol](canonical-evidence-r5.43.md).

## R5.42 locked static support-transfer pre-pass halt (2026-10-04)

Observed **`R5_42_PROTOCOL_HALT`** before B02 support exposure. The attempted
evaluation recorder passed 678 historical and 695 prospective pinned-byte checks
and 14 focused tests, then rejected native Python equality between its freshly
constructed independent matrix and JSON-loaded R5.41 evidence. In-memory tuples
become lists through JSON round-tripping. Stopped-run integrity diagnostics find
identical canonical JSON, SHA-256
`02e3c3723a74d16458114760c0c917afbc7597e3ad76c62553014a475471513c`.
The comparison was not corrected and pre-pass was not retried. This is a recorder
infrastructure failure, not evidence of lost R5.41 capability or missing semantics.

Verification: 400 harness discovered / 364 passed / 36 explicit prohibited-B02
skips; 31/31 application/compiler; 16 coherent independent profiles and 84 matrix
rows; validation/safety/structural schema/821-leaf traceability/contamination and
inherited locks pass. Inherited locks retain their pre-commit HEADs; ancestry and
exact bytes were checked without modifying old records. Final post-documentation
`git diff --check` passes with LF→CRLF advisory warnings for the three updated
project documents, separate from semantic results. Zero B02 static passes or CheckedPlans
formed for this review; whole-contract support/readiness/audit/admission are not
evaluated. Zero B02 generation, execution, frozen acceptance or implementation/
profile repair. Core 30/no #31; B03 prospectively untouched, B17 unexposed and
unclassified, Phase 5C paused. Recommend separately authorized R5.43 infrastructure
investigation before a newly authorized static transfer review.
Evidence: [R5.42 report](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_42-LOCKED-WHOLE-CONTRACT-STATIC-SUPPORT-TRANSFER.md)
and `R5_42-halt-verification.json` beside it.

## R5.41 independent optional-boundary support coherence (2026-10-04)

Observed: the historical scalar binder already decodes nullable non-null text
through its underlying decoder; transport admission incorrectly requires JSON
for any dictionary-shaped element. Independently, the durable population-domain
runtime indexes absent optional fields after the structural codec admits them.
Readiness v2 checks declared content-rule coverage without establishing that
runtime composition. These are infrastructure composition defects expressible
with the existing 30 semantics, not evidence requiring #31.

Prospective admission/runtime use shared decoder-representation and present-domain
rules. A shared compatible-path assessment feeds both readiness and supplemental
audit. The prospective public bundle preserves absent/null/present distinctions
and validates staged post-state before commit. Invalid text, type failures,
required omission, unsupported decoder combinations and present invalid domains
remain rejected. Historical R5.39/R5.40 implementations and authority are preserved.

Evidence: 16 generic scalar/optionality/representation profiles agree across
readiness, supplemental audit and aggregate admission (14 support, two Boolean/text
reject); 84 raw/value-state rows; 15 independently grounded and semantically
conformant standalone public calls across integer/string/instant; 14 focused tests
including rejection/byte preservation, finite public string domains, nullable
collections, state alternatives, identity/nonblank constraints and corrupt support
bytes. Readiness is support prediction, not per-value acceptance: a supported
profile correctly rejects an invalid supplied or durable value. Explicit null
uses JSON; text-profile null probes are scoped to the raw binder, not mislabeled
as a public null spelling.

Final verification: 400 harness discovered/364 pass/36 prohibited-B02 skips;
31/31 application/compiler; historical evidence 5 pass/one historical live-lock
skip; validation/safety/structural schema/99-leaf source trace/contamination pass;
all 678 historical lock members and 681 tracked authority files unchanged;
695-file prospective lock and diff check pass. A first 120-second invocation timed
out; completed recorded reruns supply the results. Zero B02 static reevaluations,
generation, execution or acceptance. B03 has no prospective exposure; B17 remains
unexposed/unclassified.

Result R5_41_SUPPORT_COHERENCE_READY, bounded independent support closure, not
full frozen-contract readiness or universal correctness. Core 30/no #31, Phase 5C
paused. Recommend separately authorized R5.42 locked whole-contract static support
transfer with no post-pass repair. See
[R5.41 evidence](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_41-INDEPENDENT-OPTIONAL-BOUNDARY-SUPPORT-COHERENCE.md).

## R5.40 boundary-profile admission and B02 configuration (2026-10-04)

Observed: a one-operation non-task profile with its sole optional input unmapped
is admitted by preserved R5.39 aggregate compatibility and rejected by readiness
v2. The prospective R5.40 admission entry requires exact declared public-input
coverage. Fourteen independent tests pass across minimal/seed-bank/publication
profiles, mapping faults, stale identities, decoder compatibility, declarative
schema/contamination and source-trace faults. No new core semantic construct.

Frozen B02 boundary metadata was reconstructed from actual request/baseline/schema
and original frozen oracle clauses. The live oracle has a later Phase 5D change;
the Phase 5B Git blob matches its pinned frozen SHA-256 and was read as text only.
No Conventional internals or generated target supplied metadata. Four alternatives
(bare V1, envelope V2/V3, current V4), seven public commands and 28 state/public pairs
produce 19 route bindings for 15 unchanged operation contracts. Only application
state registration splits equal-codec legacy identities; algorithms remain in the
original semantic contracts. All 821 profile leaves have exact source records.
Structural schema and source/contamination audit pass as CONFIGURATION_ONLY;
complete checked-profile admission does not pass.

After a 678-file byte lock, exactly one static readiness v2 call forms 15/15 plans
and returns NOT_READY. Its four raw diagnostics arise from plain-text nullable
due-date binding and downstream transport/aggregate/checked-route rejection.
Supplemental generic static checks expose optional population-domain support on
three legacy alternatives: an independent non-task optional habitat witness is
schema-admitted and structurally valid, but its absent field fails decoding because
the domain implementation indexes the missing key. Readiness v2 only checks declared
rule equality and misses this support composition. The complete report preserves
two generic support roots, their occurrences/consequences and the analyzer defect.
The possible scalar version-domain gap was resolved with configuration before lock.

Verification: full restricted harness 386 discovered/350 pass/36 explicit prohibited
B02 skips; application/compiler 31/31; new focused 14/14; R5.37 evidence 5 pass/one
historical live-tree-lock skip; validation/safety/source/structural/contamination
checks pass. Lock verifies before/after/final; diff check passes. Windows Python
3.14.3/PowerShell 7/autocrlf true; no environment failure explains these findings.
No B02 generation, execution, acceptance or post-static implementation/profile
repair. Earlier 84-cell matrix and 256 grounded-call evidence are unchanged.

Result R5_40_GENERIC_CAPABILITY_GAP. Recommend R5.41 independent public-decoder,
optional durable-domain and readiness support coherence, not comprehensive B02
evaluation. Specification-derived application configuration is legitimate, but
declarations alone do not supply missing generic behavior. Core 30/no #31; Phase 5C
paused; B03 prospectively untouched; B17 unexposed/unclassified; format globally
unfrozen; R5.2.2 historical authority; universal correctness unclaimed.
See [R5.40 result/evidence](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_40-BOUNDARY-PROFILE-ADMISSION-B02-CONFIGURATION.md).

## R5.39 refinement dependency and whole-contract boundary review (2026-10-04)

Implemented observations: the R5.38 analyzer rejects nine minimal redundant-guard
selected-order fixtures; the historical optional analyzer accepts the three
optional-only cases. The current analyzer preserves all provider justifications
in one scoped fact and accepts all nine. Independent generated regressions also
exercise presence-only, non-null-only and combined duplicate providers in three
serialization placements, with guarded consumers and real absent/null populations.
Existing emitter/verifier scheduling consumes the corrected checked representation.

Nullable public decoding now composes the existing scalar decoder, preserving
omitted, supplied null, supplied valid value and failed binding. A seed-bank
application composes V1/V2 codecs, declared population/content constraints, generic
state-alternative routes, migration, checked launch and one aggregate profile.
Public subprocess observations challenge every reached layer independently.
Seven invalid populations reject before semantic invocation and preserve bytes.
Disposable binding/dispatch/persistence faults and aggregate metadata challenges
are separate from positive execution evidence.

Readiness v2 predicts READY for the complete independent application and enumerates
seven findings across binding, state, transport, launch and aggregate-profile stages
for a deliberately incomplete application. The original 84 cells remain 64 supported
and 20 rejected. Baseline and duplicate-provider matrices each transfer 64 cells
through 128 grounded calls. The 336 static rows preserve applicable/N/A distinctions;
separate boundary evidence is not falsely counted as execution of every matrix row.

Methodological progress: multiple independent boundary gaps are detected before
generation, rather than discovered by serial frozen retries. Limits remain:
nested-selection refinement propagation, complete authored obligation coverage,
load-validation versus universal write preservation, crash/concurrent persistence,
and hostile-runtime attestation. Core remains 30, new core 0; no #31. The result
artifact records the subsequent locked, static-only B02 outcome and full remaining
set. Frozen history and R5.38's defect evidence remain preserved.
The 658-file lock verifies before/after the single static B02 pass: 15 CheckedPlans,
whole-contract NOT_READY. Six findings remain: absent transport/state/launch/
aggregate profiles and absent alternative-routing/content-constraint coverage.
No B02 generation/execution/acceptance, no post-static repair, no retry recommendation.
Result R5_39_WHOLE_CONTRACT_BOUNDARY_PARTIAL; independent capabilities do not
substitute for missing concrete contract metadata.
Additional post-lock independent static observation: deleting V2 query's optional
filter mapping remains aggregate-compatible but correctly returns NOT_READY under
readiness v2. No generation/B02 inspection or implementation repair followed.
Aggregate admission is not yet an unconditional completeness gate; preserve this
distinction for the next independent coverage review.

## R5.38 nullable domain and whole-contract coherence (2026-10-04)

Implemented observation: the prospective authoritative analyzer recognizes existing
negated typed-null equality as a scoped non-null witness and generically eliminates
nullable<T>. Optional field presence remains separate; optional<nullable<T>> needs
both facts. Sealed CheckedPlan includes declared/effective types, independent
presence/nullability states and stable producer/scope identities. The emitter
consumes checked scheduling; the verifier independently interprets semantic source
over observed values. No core relation or scalar-specific refinement branch added.

Independent publication evidence: eight normal generated/grounded/conformant calls
(nullable before/order, optional and combined-domain reads, string/integer consumers,
replace/remove), five conformant source-only mutations, three disposable faults
that ground but fail semantics, and seven layered conformant standalone public
calls with shared durable state. Wrong-field/record/scope and unguarded uses reject.
All six combined-domain conjunction orders execute equivalently. An 84-combination
domain/refinement matrix gives 64 supported current-pipeline transfers, 20 pre-generation
rejections and 128 grounded calls. These are finite witnesses, not universal proof.

Methodological correction: **R5.36 readiness conclusion was too coarse with respect
to nullable refinement.** Its historical R5_36_READY_FOR_COMPREHENSIVE_B02_RETRY result
is retained. R5.23 explicitly identified nullable composition; capability aggregation
lost the exact operand-domain obligation, substituted optional evidence and treated
matrix consistency as whole-contract closure. Revised readiness walks whole source,
records exact domains/refinement prerequisites/state/composition/stages, validates
complete profiles and fails closed for missing/unknown boundary obligations. A complete
non-task application predicts successful generation; a semantically safe nested
selection ordering fixture detects unsupported population-fact propagation statically.

After independent implementation/evidence/verification lock (625 protected files,
identity 46d380be742eb11f6081b2ba548ed80d62a37c13789734f6b819234d06640e5c), one descriptive
B02 static pass forms 15/15 saved operation-family CheckedPlans, including required
nullable before and optional-nullable fallback. Whole-contract NOT_READY: nullable
public decoding, one public route over multiple state alternatives, durable
population/content validation, and missing complete transport/state/launch profiles.
All six findings are collected together; three are capability gaps and three missing
coverage obligations, not observed behavior failures. No B02 generation, execution,
acceptance or serial frontier retry. Locked hashes and HEAD remain unchanged.

Verification: Windows/Python 3.14.3/PowerShell 7; complete restriction-aware harness
discovery 360 tests, 324 pass, 36 explicit restrictions (35 historical B02 rendering/
execution probes plus one nested frozen acceptance replay). Application/compiler
31/31; model validation/safety; 13 new tests; 37 R5.25–R5.31 optional regressions;
architecture/grounding/semantic/binding/evolution/transport/launch families pass.
R5.37 immutable evidence checks 5 pass, historical live-tree lock assertion 1 skip
because two prospective implementation files intentionally changed. No skips counted
as passes. Diff check and evidence integrity audit pass. Initial shell-assignment
parse error and disposable fault-injection binding-name correction occurred before
final verification/lock; LF→CRLF future-checkout warnings are environment-only.

Post-lock independent audit: a non-task optional selected ordering with two
equivalent presence guards is accepted by the pinned historical analyzer but
rejected by current CheckedPlan ordering invariants. Two equivalent nullable
non-null guards fail similarly. Scope maps retain one producer per fact while
ordering records both producers; the redundant producer lacks a retained scope
entry. This is a real implementation regression/incomplete idempotent conjunction
composition, separate from environment notices and the B02 static gaps. No
post-static implementation repair or B02 reanalysis; original 625-file lock intact.
Prior test-count success cannot establish preservation of optional semantics.

Gate R5_38_NULLABLE_COHERENCE_PARTIAL: demonstrated nullable integration and
readiness improvements remain incomplete. Exact recommendation:
R5.39 Independent Refinement Dependency and Whole-Contract Boundary Closure Review,
repairing/regressing canonical producer consistency for redundant guards and
independently completing the entire known boundary set and
profiles before any future retry recommendation. Candidate core 30/no #31; TYPE
SYSTEM/CHECKED PLAN/READINESS ANALYSIS/TESTING-EVIDENCE accounting only. Phase 5C
paused, B03 prospectively untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, format globally
unfrozen, R5.2.2 historical authority, universal correctness NO.
Evidence: `benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_38-NULLABLE-DOMAIN-WHOLE-CONTRACT-COHERENCE.md`,
`R5_38-summary.json`, `R5_38-B02-static-readiness.json`;
interface: `docs/nullable-readiness-r5.38.md`.

## R5.37 comprehensive frozen B02 evaluation (2026-10-03)

Evaluation observation: clean HEAD `428a3409ea4d47a57a9fc9e5a94af2595d98ec43`,
224 protected byte hashes locked before complete B02 generation. Direct frozen
B02/B01/baseline/oracle/profile reconstruction records 24 obligation rows and four
underspecified areas. Existing 30 abstract candidates can state the contract, but
one faithful current-format operation-family attempt through current_pipeline fails
before rendering: `before requires two typed instants; optional operand needs
in-scope presence`. Actual left operand is required nullable<instant>; the source's
non-null guard does not create an accepted elimination witness. Optional membership
refinement is a different composition. R5.23 explicitly described this nullable
blocker; R5.36's readiness gate had not actually closed it.

Generation classification UNKNOWN_TYPE_COHERENCE_GAP; decision
R5_37_B02_INTEGRATION_GAP. No complete checked source/executable/profile/provenance,
no public launches, zero grounded cases, seven applicable frozen methods BLOCKED
(0 PASS/FAIL/SKIP), zero new demonstrated complete frozen-B02 capability transfers.
No source mutation, implementation repair, fallback compiler or reduced-slice retry
after the halt. Static nullable input-binding, one-public-route/multiple-state-shape
dispatch and nonstructural durable validity concerns are recorded as unexecuted
integration risks, not additional measured failures. The attempt does not certify
complete source authority. Malformed-input public failures need not be typed
semantic invocations; that R5.23 interpretation was stronger than frozen prose.

Verification: Python 3.14.3/Windows 11, core.autocrlf=true; full harness 347/347
(131.701 s), application/compiler 31/31, model validation/safety, readiness matrix
and 58 focused architecture tests pass. Initial 120-second tool timeout was resolved
by a 600-second limit, not an implementation change. Direct full discovery replayed
existing historical B03 acceptance on an old checkpoint; no new B03 candidate run
or prospective exposure occurred. Six R5.37 evidence integrity tests pass; final
224-file lock and HEAD unchanged; diff check passes. Newline conversion is distinct
from the real nullable-domain rejection.

Research limitation: neighboring-domain success and a green readiness checklist
do not demonstrate whole-contract transfer. B02 is not fully held out; its known
blockers influenced prior development. No comparative superiority or universal
correctness follows. Recommend R5.38 independent nullable-domain and whole-contract
boundary coherence review before another authorized B02 retry. Core remains 30,
no #31; Phase 5C paused again, R5.2.2 historical authority, format globally unfrozen,
B17 unexposed/unclassified, UNIVERSAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CORRECTNESS_ESTABLISHED=NO.
Evidence: `benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_37-B02-COMPREHENSIVE-FROZEN-EVALUATION.md`,
`R5_37-B02-CONTRACT-RECONSTRUCTION.md`, `R5_37-generation-evidence.json`,
`R5_37-evaluation-matrix.json`, `R5_37-implementation-lock.json`.

## R5.36 checked public launch profile completion (2026-10-03)

Implemented observation: public-only subprocess launch now derives the four
R5.35 infrastructure parameters from checked co-located metadata and internal
bootstrap. Generic cwd-relative store/evidence resolution, provider selection,
invocation allocation and trace emission preserve the existing compiler/binding/
transport/persistence authorities. Launch contains no domain predicates, collection
normalization, defaults, migration or state-transition logic. Ambient capability
environment is overwritten; copied bundles need no repository PYTHONPATH.

Independent acoustic station (calibration plus clock/identity stamp) and unchanged
R5.33 specimen application use identical launcher bytes. Machine evidence records
33 processes: A 6, B 9, path/environment 6, faults 6 and metadata mutations 6.
Nineteen normal calls ground and conform at applicable layers; two declared
directory-precondition failures reject before execution. Missing reads remain
store-file-free; first generated insertion materializes V1, migration produces V2,
and subsequent calls share exact durable byte continuity. Two cwd directories per
application follow the same profile and executable rather than repository paths.

Faults expose stale application identity, real writes to an unexpected store,
foreign trace identity, required hidden helper, incompatible capability provider
and consumed public argv. Four compatible metadata-only changes preserve generated
algorithm bytes and launcher digest; two incompatible transport/persistence hash
references reject. Separate launch/transport/input/persistence/semantic/output
verdicts retain null for unreached layers. Trace identity corruption refuses
grounding even when execution produced a generated result.

Implementation/evidence were hash locked before descriptive frozen B02/baseline
comparison; no implementation repair followed. All known benchmark-critical
readiness classes are independently resolved or profile-configuration-only. Gate
R5_36_READY_FOR_COMPREHENSIVE_B02_RETRY; exact next recommendation: R5.37 =
comprehensive frozen B02 retry. Native packaging/installation/HTTP/production
observability would move readiness goalposts beyond the frozen contract; they
do not justify another preparatory phase. Complete frozen integration/acceptance
is still unexecuted, not inferred from these independent examples.

Windows PowerShell/Python 3.14.3: 347 harness tests discovered, 346 pass with one
fail-closed nested frozen-B02 restriction skip (104.424 s); all 14 new launch tests
pass, 31 application/compiler tests pass (2.730 s), validation/safety and readiness
matrix pass. No Python/environment failure or LF mirror; newline conversion notices
are separate from failures. Core 30/no #31; 46 historical raw entries unchanged.
B02 not retried/accepted, Phase 5C paused, B03 untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified,
R5.2.2 historical authority, semantic-first format globally unfrozen, universal
implementation correctness unclaimed. Crash/concurrent persistence and hostile
runtime fidelity remain unestablished. Evidence:
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_36-CHECKED-PUBLIC-LAUNCH-PROFILE.md`,
`R5_36-launch-evidence.json`, `R5_36-readiness-matrix.json`; interface:

## R5.35 generic transport boundary completion review (2026-10-03)

Implemented observation: three bounded generic extensions of R5.34 consume the
same authoritative CheckedPlans/current_pipeline. Repeated and JSON-array inputs
preserve order/duplicates and pass each element through unchanged R5.32 decoding.
Omitted collection, explicitly empty and supplied values remain distinguishable;
generated acoustic calibration alone trims/deduplicates/nonblank-checks. Public
direct/object presentation checks payload paths/types/coverage/collisions and
maps independent semantic/binding/persistence categories to stdout/stderr/exit.
No asynchronous or multi-record stream runtime was justified or implemented.

Explicit checked state declarations supply missing semantic origin under lazy
INITIALIZE_DECLARED_STATE; REQUIRE_EXISTING rejects without invocation/creation.
Missing read leaves physical absence intact; generated insertion materializes V1,
migration produces V2 and subsequent operations use V2. Physical bytes/existence
and effective semantic pre-state are independently challenged. Invalid JSON and
invalid state shape preserve bytes and fail persistence before semantic execution.

Machine evidence: 39 observations, comprising 12 acoustic calls, 11 specimen
calls, 10 faults (A-H plus wrong stream/exit) and 6 metadata-only mutations.
All 23 normal and 6 mutation calls pass applicable layers; 14 normal calls have
typed semantic executions. Faults expose reversal, duplicate removal, malformed
drop, success under failure presentation, payload omission, forbidden creation,
wrong initialized version, wrong public initialization report and stream/status
mismatch. Public corruption preserves semantic conformance. Wrong-version origin
is valid for another state shape but violates the checked initial reference.
All six metadata mutations have identical adapter digest. Fourteen focused tests
also cover every-element visitation, required-empty input, direct/projected output,
empty-root count-zero migration and stale/resealed policy authority.

Implementation was hash locked before descriptive B02/baseline text comparison;
no generic implementation repair followed it. New observation: standalone
public-only argv and cwd-relative store/trace bootstrap lack a checked launch
profile. R5.34's configuration-only classification for this convention was not
demonstrated and is corrected prospectively. The three requested boundary areas
are resolved independently; overall transport binding remains partial. Gate
R5_35_GENERIC_TRANSPORT_BOUNDARY_PARTIAL; recommend independent R5.36 Checked
Public Launch Profile Completion Review, not comprehensive B02 retry yet.
Malformed-input **public** mapping is resolved; no malformed untyped value is
represented as a fabricated operation-declared semantic event.

Windows PowerShell/Python 3.14.3: full harness 333 discovered, 332 pass and one
fail-closed nested frozen-B02 restriction skip (88.997 s); 31 application/compiler
tests pass, model validation/safety and capability matrix pass. No environment
failures or LF mirror; Git newline notices are separate from actual failures.
Core 30, no #31, 46 historical raw entries unchanged. No B02 retry/acceptance,
Phase 5C paused, B03 untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2 historical
authority, semantic-first format globally unfrozen, universal correctness
unclaimed. Direct materialization is not crash atomic; concurrent initialization
and hostile-runtime fidelity remain unestablished. Evidence:
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_35-GENERIC-TRANSPORT-BOUNDARY-COMPLETION.md` and
`R5_35-transport-evidence.json`; rules: `docs/transport-boundary-r5.35.md`.

## R5.34 prospective checked transport binding (2026-10-03)

Observation: current internal dispatch supports checked semantic keys/codecs but
is not a public transport. Generic run_cli performs early scalar/presence policy;
R5.32's public JSON adapter preserves raw binding but lacks public route/outcome
classification. New checked public profiles consume authoritative plan facts and
drive a generic flag/value CLI around the unchanged R5.32 binder/current_pipeline.
Transport contains no application transitions, defaults, predicates or migration.
Requiredness/outcome shapes originate in CheckedPlan; digests bind source/unit/
generation and copied artifacts. Stale regeneration blocks before invocation.

Actual evidence: 15 mineral-catalogue public calls, 10 specimen cross-shape lifecycle
calls, 10 before/after version-unavailable calls, 5 metadata/source mutations and
6 disposable faults (46 observations). All 25 normal calls pass applicable layers;
18 execute typed semantics, 5 fail binding and 2 fail routing/grammar. Both five-call
cross-shape lifecycles share durable state (8 adjacent byte links). All mutations
follow metadata with unchanged adapter bytes. Unavailable calls preserve bytes,
have INVOCATION_FAILURE and no semantic event; no semantic verdict is invented.
Faults expose wrong routing, false suppliedness, incompatible decoder, failure
encoded as success, omitted result field and forbidden transport durable mutation.
Public corruption faults preserve semantic conformance; independent readback
exposes transport mutation despite matching public output. Integrity alone is
not behavioral conformance or hostile-writer attestation.

Gate R5_34_CHECKED_TRANSPORT_VALIDATED for bounded generic architecture. Subsequent
descriptive B02/baseline text comparison (no fixture template/acceptance/candidate)
finds repeated collection flags, configurable bare/stdout versus stderr error
encoding and checked absent-store/persistence policy outside the prototype.
Malformed-input operation-declared mapping remains partial. Recommend R5.35
independent Generic Transport Boundary Completion Review, not comprehensive retry.
No implementation edits followed the descriptive comparison. Windows Python
3.14.3: full 319 discovered, 318 pass, 1 explicit nested frozen-B02 restriction
skip; 31 application/compiler pass, validation/safety and matrix pass. No Python
environment failures; Git LF-to-CRLF notices remain separate from diff checks.

Core 30, no #31, historical raw inventory 46 unchanged. B02 not retried/accepted,
Phase 5C paused, B03 untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2 historical
authority, format globally unfrozen, universal correctness unclaimed. Direct
durable writing remains non-transactional/crash-nonatomic. Evidence:

## Long-term research/publication note (2026-10-03)

Lykoi is being developed as an experimental AI-native software-development
system and may eventually form the basis of a research publication if the
evidence becomes substantive. This note records a long-term possibility within
the existing research log and [decision structure](decisions.md); it does not
initiate a paper or alter the current R5.x experiment or benchmark governance.

- Do not optimize experiments for a positive paper result. Positive, negative
  and null findings are all valid research outcomes. If evidence does not support
  the original hypothesis, preserve and report it rather than adapting the
  evaluation to obtain a positive result.
- Preserve historical experiment artifacts, failures, architectural revisions,
  benchmark freezes and test results rather than rewriting history. Continue
  distinguishing semantic adequacy, compiler capability, grounded case evidence
  and universal correctness.
- Preserve AI model/tool identities, versions where available, and their roles
  in the research/development workflow, with enough context to support an accurate
  future methodology section.
- Make no publication claim such as “Lykoi is better than conventional
  programming” without supporting controlled evidence.
- Before any future held-out evaluation, define hypotheses, metrics, controls,
  comparison methodology and evaluation protocol before revealing or executing
  held-out tasks. Keep the future held-out benchmark from influencing semantic
  or compiler development before the architecture being evaluated is frozen.

## R5.33 prospective cross-shape state evolution (2026-10-03)

Observation: the historical operation-contract proposal and current state slots,
relation bindings, first-unit runtime codec and implicit root frame assumed one
shape. Existing #44's exact keyed row equation and typed target equalities can
compose add/default fields with complete envelope construction; arbitrary
per-record rename/removal is not supplied by string-only map/for_each or evolution
lineage metadata. The pre-implementation decision is
EXISTING_OPERATION_CONTRACT_GENERALIZATION, not a new semantic construct.
Authoritative checking now carries independent pre/post shapes, side-qualified
field/collection facts, applicability and evolution mode in the sealed plan.
The same current pipeline generates separate codecs and applicability predicates;
the verifier checks each concrete type and independently evaluates relations.

Two non-task mineral-register applications each execute a seven-call durable
lifecycle: V1 read/insert/read, migration, V2 read/insert/read. Fourteen actual
calls ground and conform with 12 adjacent byte links. One changes row typing;
one changes a root array to a revision-2 envelope. Optional scientific provenance
and present medium survive; missing medium is constructed. Count reports the
whole four-specimen migration population. Two source-only default/metadata
mutations propagate into durable V2 values. Faults A–E ground and fail semantics;
partial migration requires a disclosed faulty disposable post-codec descriptor
to reach persistence. Version-unavailable calls preserve bytes and have no
semantic event. Empty/two-default/source-field-absent fixtures also conform.

Limitations: one-level root projections, structural types, no arbitrary record
map, no nominal version sum, no transactional/locked/crash-safe durable write or
hostile-runtime proof. Computing/checking before write does not prove atomicity.
After adding lifecycle insertion, two fixture literal types required correction;
a later refactor changed R5.29's binding-rejection order and was corrected by
restoring early registration checks. Final affected/full suites pass; these were
real fixture/regression errors, not environment failures. Windows Python
3.14.3 passes 307/308 full harness tests with one explicit skip preventing nested
frozen B02 acceptance, plus all 31 application/compiler tests, validation and
safety. Ten new focused tests and matrix validation pass. LF→CRLF notices are
separate; historical hash checks pass directly in this workspace.

Gate R5_33_CROSS_SHAPE_EVOLUTION_VALIDATED, bounded cross-shape class resolved
independently; core 30, no #31, frozen transport unresolved. Recommend R5.34
independent checked transport review. Malformed-input operation-outcome mapping
remains separate/partially resolved. No B02 retry/acceptance or transport work,
Phase 5C paused, B03 untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, format unfrozen,
R5.2.2 historical authority; universal correctness unclaimed. Evidence:
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_33-CROSS-SHAPE-STATE-EVOLUTION.md` and
`R5_33-evolution-evidence.json`; profile: `docs/state-evolution-r5.33.md`.

## R5.32 prospective input binding boundary (2026-10-03)

Observation: CheckedPlan already carries sufficient authoritative input shapes;
no type-system change or extra analysis was needed. Generic scalar binding and
explicit finite-domain metadata now surround current_pipeline. The generated
observatory console preserves omitted preferred/seen keys, produces quiet through
semantic fallback, and distinguishes explicitly supplied quiet through existing
present semantics, public tags and durable nested membership. Malformed instant,
integer, string and outside-domain raw values fail before invocation. Integer 8,
boundary instant and domain-valid/state-forbidden modes bind then return semantic
rule_rejected. Eighteen shared-store cases ground/conform at the appropriate
layers, with ten semantic invocations and eight binding failures; three source
mutations propagate defaults, types and domain predicates. All four disposable
faults ground and fail binding conformance; forbidden Fault C invocation produces
independently observed durable mutation. Binding failure has no semantic event or
semantic conformance verdict. Diagnostic provenance avoids raw values; synthetic
research fixtures deliberately retain their non-sensitive raw examples.

Python 3.12.10 in an isolated LF checkout runs full harness discovery: 298 found,
297 pass, one restriction skip for a historical method that would execute frozen
B02 acceptance. Historical tests are unchanged. The 31 application/compiler
tests, model validation, safety, focused binding tests and capability matrix pass.
LF→CRLF Git notices are separate from actual failures. Suppliedness/well-formedness
is resolved independently; malformed-input outcomes are partially resolved because
validated public failure mapping does not fabricate operation-declared outcomes.
Limitations include scalar-only public shapes, no nominal enum, standard JSON
duplicate-key policy, resource limits and no physical no-write/hostile-runtime
attestation. Core remains 30 with no #31. R5.33 recommendation: independently
review cross-shape state evolution, preserving the single-authority pipeline.
No B02 retry/acceptance, cross-shape implementation or benchmark activation.
Evidence: `benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_32-INPUT-BINDING-TYPED-FAILURE-BOUNDARY.md`
and `R5_32-binding-evidence.json`; interface rules: `docs/input-binding-r5.32.md`.

## R5.31 prospective semantic-authority consolidation (2026-10-03)

Observation: the current analyzer now records complete checked expression facts
as it validates, with declared/effective types and presence producer/scope
dependencies. Generation, projection/order/state/outcome binding and independent
interpretation consume these facts; older expression evaluation no longer
retypes through `_compile`. Runtime capability shapes also come from the plan.
Eight new tests expose the legacy rejection of a checked refined instant order,
poison alternative typers and downstream analysis, reject contradictory checked
maps, retain authoritative clock typing despite a contradictory runtime fallback
table, and propagate source-only ordering/projection/normalization/fallback
changes to grounded conformant behavior. The five-operation archive retains its
eight-call durable chain; the inventory retains normalization/order/defaults/
migration; Faults A–E ground but fail conformance. Architecture gate validated
for the supported same-shape subset, not universally or for frozen B02.

Final Python 3.12.10/LF-checkout verification passes 286 harness tests, 31
application/compiler tests, model validation, safety and matrix checks. Initial
local verification used Python 3.9 and CRLF bytes on untouched pinned inputs,
causing real version/hash failures; the isolated supported-runtime/LF rerun
resolved them without changing frozen locks. Git LF→CRLF notices are recorded
separately. The full harness includes unchanged historical B02 diagnostics and
nested Conventional acceptance regressions, not a new B02 retry or acceptance
gate. Core stays 30, no #31; independent suppliedness/well-formedness,
malformed-input outcomes, cross-shape state and transport classes remain open.
R5.32 recommendation is a bounded semantic review, not immediate implementation.
Evidence and complete audit:
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_31-SINGLE-SEMANTIC-AUTHORITY-CONSOLIDATION.md`.

## R5.30 prospective structured assembly (2026-10-03)

The R5.29 five-operation archive now compiles from source-bound checked plans
through generated units rather than extracted rendered Python. Repeated
generation produces identical artifact and provenance bytes. An omitted
optional archive timestamp remains absent after insertion while a supplied
timestamp survives; a current-pipeline presence/before read excludes the
former and refines the latter. A disposable read operation rewrites a different
row during execution: public result and logged pre/post match independent
observations (grounded), but the read-only contract fails conformance. A–D
remain grounded nonconformances. A separate inventory application grounds
normalization, integer/string ordering, overlapping defaults and a same-shape
version/count transition through the current entry. The 278-test historical
harness and 31-test application suite pass, but repeated type analysis and
legacy inference prevent the full architecture gate. Core 30; no new semantic
capability or B02 retry. Evidence and limits:
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_30-CURRENT-PIPELINE-HARDENING-STRUCTURED-ASSEMBLY.md`.

## R5.29 prospective application integration (2026-10-03)

A five-operation publication archive runs from one generated artifact with one
durable file: two creates, a refined and ordered read, replacement, later read,
removal and final read. Independent before/after bytes connect every adjacent
call; external UTC instant and a persisted present optional instant survive
serialization into chronological ordering and scoped `before`. Grounded faults
A–D fail semantic conformance. An out-of-band durable mutation makes the next
independent pre-state differ from the prior post-state, but is not a write-caused
fault E. Omitted optional input referenced in a record constructor does not
produce a persisted absent key. R5.27's legacy checker delegation, downstream
self-checking and render-text assembly remain architectural duplication, and
historical general-capability tests do not establish transfer through the new
entry. Hence the R5.29 gate is partial; core 30, no new capability or B02 retry.
Evidence: `benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_29-AUTHORITATIVE-PIPELINE-CONSOLIDATION.md`.

## R5.28 prospective refined-plan observation (2026-10-03)

The unified checker now produces source-identity-bound witness dependencies,
typed relation operands and ordering plans. A prospective fork of the general
emitter/verifier generated grounded non-task refined reads, chronological
ordered reads, guarded keyed replacement and removal, plus required-instant
external insertion. Four disposable faults (absent match, lost secondary order,
wrong replacement field, external/persistence divergence) remained grounded
but failed semantic conformance. Semantic-only mutations altered refinement,
cutoff, key, replacement value and remove predicate without editing the fork.
These are individual operations, not one generated multi-command program.
No shared durable-state continuity or read-after-write optional closure was
established. The pinned general R5.23 pipeline cannot consume the checked plan
without a separately versioned integration interface. Candidate core remains
30; no B02 retry or benchmark-boundary advance. Detailed audit and limitations:
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_28-REFINED-PLAN-CONSUMPTION-INTEGRATION.md`.

## R5.27 typed-analysis checkpoint (prospective, 2026-10-03)

**Observation:** One new R5.27 checker checks read selection/order and typed
write operands over the same input/pre/post shapes. Independent archive-domain
static fixtures exercise both conjunction serialization orders, invalid
optional-witness scopes, instant ordering, external instant insertion typing,
and selection-guarded keyed removal/replacement typing.

**Observation:** A required-instant archive insertion also passes the new
checker and the legacy general generator; independent subprocess/event/durable
grounding and historical conformance agree on the externally supplied instant.

**Limit:** This is not generated, grounded, fault-tested *refined* read/write integration.
The pinned general emitter and verifier remain unable to consume the new
checker directly; no R5.27 multi-command durable program exists. Gate
`R5_27_UNIFIED_TYPED_PIPELINE_PARTIAL`; R5.23 type blockers remain partially
resolved, with malformed outcomes, cross-shape migration and frozen transport
separate. Core 30, no #31, no B02 retry. See the
[R5.27 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_27-UNIFIED-TYPED-PIPELINE-INTEGRATION.md).

**Verification:** full harness 263/263, application/compiler 31/31, model
validation ok, safety zero violations/invalid transitions, focused R5.27 4/4,
matrix parses, `git diff --check` exit 0. Git LF→CRLF notices were not failures.

## R5.26 general type integration (prospective, 2026-10-03)

**Observation:** A versioned R5.26 read-only #45 path checks the same positive
conjunction for `present(optional<T>)` and consumers in either serialization
order, then emits guarded selections and chronological instant ordering. The
publication-domain generated operations select exact absent/before/after/equal
populations; optional string/integer runs and optional instant + before +
ordered-selection runs exercise genericity. Independent subprocess output,
internal event, durable byte readback and per-operation provenance ground the
executions. Wrong absent-row inclusion and reversed instant order ground but
fail conformance; wrong-target refinement rejects before generation.

**Limit:** The full historical general generator and verifier remain pinned;
this is a separately versioned read-only integration profile, not complete
whole-program closure. R5.23 type blockers resolve independently in that
profile, not for all writing/mixed-branch operations. Input validity/malformed
outcomes, cross-shape migration and frozen transport are distinct future work.
Gate `R5_26_REFINEMENT_INSTANT_INTEGRATION_PARTIAL`; 30 candidates, no #31,
no B02 retry. See the [R5.26 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_26-GENERAL-TYPE-REFINEMENT-INSTANT-INTEGRATION.md).

**Verification:** `python -m unittest discover -s benchmark/harness -v`
259/259 after the pinned-file restoration (including R5.10–R5.25, architecture,
grounding, R5.25 prototype and six new R5.26 tests); application/compiler
`$env:PYTHONPATH='src'; python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` 31/31;
`python -m air_compiler.cli validate air/task_manager.json` ok and
`python -m air_compiler.cli safety air/task_manager.json` zero violations or
invalid transitions with `PYTHONPATH=src`; focused R5.26 6/6. The first full
harness run found a pinned evidence-file hash mismatch from an attempted hook;
the hook was removed and the unchanged pinned file passed the final full run.
`git diff --check` reports only LF→CRLF Git notices, not failures.

## R5.25 optional-presence/refinement review (prospective, 2026-10-03)

**Observation:** Existing typed records distinguish a missing optional key
from a present value; `optional<nullable<T>>` additionally admits present null.
Existing equality, fallback, defaults and #45 selection do not type-check a
presence-guarded optional projection. The separate R5.25 type-directed
elimination prototype generates publication selection for either conjunction
serialization; absent/before/after/equal rows select only the earlier row.
Unsafe unguarded, wrong-field, non-optional and escaping refinements reject.
A disposable emitted fault includes the absent row, remains publicly and
durably grounded, and fails independent semantic conformance. The witness is
generic over optional string/integer/record/instant at the type boundary, but
only instant's `before` consumer is generated. See the
[R5.25 review](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_25-OPTIONAL-PRESENCE-REFINEMENT-SEMANTIC-REVIEW.md).

**Limit:** The narrow prototype does not integrate with the R5.23-pinned
compiler/runtime/verifier or establish nullable refinement and general proof
scope. Decision `EXISTING_TYPE_SYSTEM_GENERALIZATION`, gate
`R5_25_OPTIONAL_REFINEMENT_RESOLVED` for the bounded semantic architecture;
R5.23 optional blocker **PARTIALLY_RESOLVED**. Candidate core remains 30;
R5.26 should integrate scoped optional elimination prospectively. No B02
retry, Phase 5C advance or claim of universal correctness. Verification:
benchmark harness 253/253 (including R5.10–R5.24), application/compiler
31/31, new focused 4/4, model validation ok, safety 0 violations/invalid
transitions, `git diff --check` clean. LF→CRLF notices were warnings only.

## R5.24 type/state coherence investigation (prospective, 2026-10-03)

**Observation:** The existing `instant` type parses checked UTC `Z` timestamps
and compares chronologically under `before`; an independent publication-domain
ordering interpreter confirms one-key and mixed-key order, ties and semantic
key mutation. The R5.23-locked generator remains limited to string/integer
keys. A separate generated publication input probe grounds omitted and
explicitly supplied fallback inputs with distinct recorded input values;
malformed supplied input fails before the semantic operation with durable bytes
unchanged, not with a typed failure outcome. A machine-readable matrix and
type-closure inventory distinguish these cases. Full harness 249/249,
application/compiler 31/31, focused new 6/6, model validation and safety
checks pass. Git LF→CRLF notices were warnings; `git diff --check` was clean.
See the [R5.24 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_24-CROSS-CAPABILITY-TYPE-STATE-COHERENCE.md).

**Limit:** Neither a generated instant-ordered program nor an optional-instant
guard, typed malformed-input outcome, cross-shape migration or integrated
non-task whole program has been demonstrated. Attempts to change R5.23-pinned
modules broke its historical integrity and first-failure tests; those edits
were rolled back before the green final harness. Existing compositions do not
provide a presence condition that refines an optional field for `before`.
Result: `R5_24_SEMANTIC_EXTENSION_REVIEW_REQUIRED`; review the semantic
constraint before any #31 choice. Core 30, B02 not retried, Phase 5C paused,
B03 untouched, B17 unexposed/unclassified, format unfrozen, R5.2.2 historical
authority and universal correctness not established.


## R5.22 known general lowering-coverage completion (prospective, 2026-10-03)

**Observation:** The known lowering-coverage backlog left by R5.21 was closed on
independent non-task domains (sensor readings and a publication archive), with no
B02 retry, generation, grounding or acceptance. Seven previously not-generative
relations/compositions are now constructively lowered through the existing general
channel and grounded: `external` values via a typed capability boundary (fresh
identity, UTC instant) that records the actual supplied value and enforces its
declared type, rejecting unknown/mismatched/missing-provider uses; omitted-input
`fallback`, kept distinct from the keyed state `default_missing`; the existing
#27 `before` promoted from validating-only to generative over the typed `instant`
form (before/equal/after); matched-row and post-transition **projection**
(`sole`/`project` plus a `post` value slot) realizing the #45 post/outcome channel;
keyed **remove** and envelope-collection-qualified **replace_field** through the
relation-set conjunction (state-shape independent, framing preserved); and an
integrated AST + generic metadata-derived **CLI binding** (`run_cli`). Two composed
end-to-end operations ran, grounded and conformed under real and controlled providers,
changed behavior under semantic-only mutation with zero lowerer edits, and failed
faithfully grounded lowering faults for external, fallback, replacement and removal.
`git diff --check` exit 0 (LF→CRLF notices only); harness 224/224; application/compiler
31/31. Four R5.21 frontier rejection expectations (`external`, `fallback`, `before`,
`sole`) were retired at their checkpoint by the R5.19/R5.20 lifecycle precedent to
type-level observations; the historical R5.21 result document is unchanged. See the
[R5.22 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_22-KNOWN-GENERAL-LOWERING-COVERAGE-COMPLETION.md).
Result: `R5_22_KNOWN_LOWERING_COVERAGE_COMPLETE`.

**Limit:** This closes the *lowering-coverage* set only. It is not a B02 candidate,
acceptance, grounding or conformance result, and does not establish that a complete
B02 operation serializes. Interface/transport obligations (error envelope/exit codes,
missing-file→`[]`, one shared store, the full multi-operation command AST,
`invalid_state` corruption mapping) and the `BENCHMARK_UNDERSPECIFIED` precedence/
malformed-tag items remain distinct from the backlog and unadvanced. No new core
construct (#31); the typed `instant`, `sole`/`project` and capability boundary are
lowering/typing/binding machinery over existing constructs, and no capability revealed
a semantic deficiency. Candidate core remains 30; Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed,
R5.2.2 historical authority, format unfrozen, universal correctness unestablished.

## R5.21 third frozen B02 generalization retry (prospective, 2026-10-03)

**Observation:** With the R5.20 suite already current (no newly obsolete
expectations; pre-lock harness 183/183, application/compiler 31/31), the locked
R5.20 architecture resolved its own benchmark debut: the exact R5.19 B02
ordered-`list` serialization now types, renders, **executes, grounds and
conforms** end-to-end — tie-decided `(created_at,id)` order judged by the
relation (exact multiset plus nondecreasing keys) over durable bytes that stay
byte-identical — while the legacy alternative returns `migration_required`
without a write. Executed B02-shaped slices also transferred R5.13 exact-HIGH
selection ∘ ordering and read-only preservation, R5.15 blank-tag guard and
`stable_unique(map(trim))` projection, R5.16 durable version transition with
#30 cardinality count, and R5.18 three-default joint composition (upgraded
from render-only). Thirteen grounded slice cases were GROUNDED + CONFORMANT;
no B02-specific lowering branch exists in the locked path.
See the [R5.21 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_21-B02-THIRD-GENERALIZATION-RETRY.md).
Result: `R5_21_B02_KNOWN_LOWERING_COVERAGE_INCOMPLETE`.

**Limit:** Complete B02 remains at the generative lowering gate. The decisive
create-success composition rejects explicitly: fresh-ID/UTC-clock value
generation (`unsupported relation: external`) and omitted-input fallback
defaults (`unsupported relation: fallback`); the integrated multi-operation
AST rejects at the same point. Frontier probes additionally recorded strict
time comparison (`before`, #27 — represented/validated only in the R5.4 typed
instant channel), matched-row/post-state outcome projection (#45 post slots
exist in the R5.12 validating checker but the generative channel binds only to
input/pre), the removal transition, and a newly observed state-shape boundary:
keyed `replace_field` lowers over plain sequences but rejects `state relation`
over the versioned envelope. None was repaired; probes were observation only.
Core 30 / historical raw 46, no #31; 0 complete B02 operations, 0 candidate,
0 frozen acceptance methods; grounding/conformance claims stay slice-level and
universal implementation correctness is not established. The serial
one-capability retry pattern is concluded: the recorded next step is a
lowering-coverage completion phase over the known set (comparisons, removal,
outcome projection, input fallback, envelope/mixed transitions, external-value
binder, integrated AST/CLI binding) before any further B02 retry. Phase 5C does
not advance to B03, B17 remains unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2 historical
authority, semantic-first format unfrozen. Post-lock verification: R5.21
focused 14 OK, full harness 197 OK, application/compiler 31 OK, locked
components re-hashed unchanged; Git LF→CRLF notices are line-ending warnings
reported separately from failures.

## R5.20 general typed ordering lowering (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The existing #43 typed ordering relation is no longer
validating-only. `benchmark/semantic/generative_r5_13.py` now builds a
target-independent ordering plan (required string/integer keys, key sequence
semantic, no direction) and emits executable ordering for media-asset and
device-inventory contracts: 1/2/3/4-key ascending orders, selection∘ordering,
typed record outcomes crossing the public boundary, and read-only listings
whose durable bytes stay untouched while storage order is not rewritten.
Semantic-only key mutations changed generated order without compiler edits;
serialization-order changes left digests/artifacts identical while key-list
permutation changed them; single-key reversal and dropped-secondary lowering
faults grounded faithfully yet failed the relation-based conformance check
(exact multiset + nondecreasing keys), which accepts either tied permutation.
See the [R5.20 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_20-GENERAL-TYPED-ORDERING-LOWERING.md).
Result: `R5_20_ORDERING_LOWERING_VALIDATED`.

**Limit:** Direction and tie stability are not represented by the current
model and were not invented: `direction` contracts and quantifier-local
ordering reject explicitly. Pre-existing interpreters diverge on ties (stable
sorted vs strict-adjacent witness), recorded as an existing ambiguity rather
than repaired. Verifier/emitter share type logic, so common-mode faults remain
possible. Core 30, no #31; historical raw 46. B02 was **not** retried — the
R5.19 historical test's current-lowerer assertion was updated by lifecycle
precedent only, and ordering benchmark transfer stays NO / NOT YET TESTED.
Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2 historical authority,
semantic-first format unfrozen, universal implementation correctness not
established. Verification: R5.20 focused 18 OK, full harness 183 OK,
application/compiler 31 OK, validate/safety OK, R5.10–R5.19 focused 32 OK,
`git diff --check` exit 0 with separate Git LF→CRLF line-ending warnings.

## R5.19 second frozen B02 generalization retry (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The R5.17 historical test's obsolete current-compiler
rejection expectation was replaced with a current typed-slice assertion; its
historical result remains untouched. Pre-lock benchmark harness 164/164,
application/compiler 31/31, focused R5.10–R5.18 pattern 31/31 and tracked
diff check passed. Locked source hashes and frozen-authority pins are in the
[R5.19 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_19-B02-SECOND-GENERALIZATION-RETRY.md).
The exact R5.17 B02-shaped migration slice now types and renders all three
defaults through the independent R5.18 plan. This is observed compiler
transfer, not an executable complete B02 operation. A typed read-only B02
normal-list contract then rejects `render` with
`UNSUPPORTED_LOWERING_CAPABILITY: order`: the earlier overlap blocker has
cleared, but full B02 remains at the general lowering gate.

**Limit:** The R5.17 migration slice omits other legacy versions and all task
commands. No complete R5.19 B02 candidate, frozen acceptance, B02 grounding or
case conformance exists; counts are N/A. No post-lock repair. Core 30 / raw 46,
no #31; Phase 5C does not advance to B03, B17 remains unexposed/unclassified,
R5.2.2 historical authority, semantic-first format unfrozen and universal
implementation correctness not established. Study ordered-result generation on
independent non-task domains in a separate experiment. Git LF→CRLF notices
are reported separately from check failures.

## R5.18 overlapping relation lowering (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The previous one-owner-per-collection check blocked N
compatible relations before generation. A typed canonical plan and joint
verifier now compose 1/2/3 independent defaults on instrument records; reverse
relation ordering is behaviorally equivalent, duplicates are redundant and
incompatible literals reject. A durable old→new transition counts records,
not defaulted fields; the injected wrong second default is grounded but fails
conformance. See the [R5.18 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_18-OVERLAPPING-RELATION-COMPOSITION-LOWERING.md).

**Limit:** Frame/default overlap, post-state-dependent or unresolved same-field
expressions and normalization/write interactions are still unsupported; no
arbitrary relation solver or general optimizer follows. Final full harness:
164 tests, 163 pass and one preserved historical R5.17 assertion fails because
it expects rejection from the old lowerer. Application/compiler 31 OK, R5.16
focused 4 OK, R5.18 focused 4 OK. `git diff --check` clean, separate LF→CRLF
warnings. Core 30 / historical raw 46, no frozen retry, Phase 5C paused,
B17 unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2 historical authority, format unfrozen;
universal correctness not established.

## R5.17 frozen B02 generalization retry (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The unchanged 30-candidate vocabulary still abstractly
represents frozen B02 including inherited B01/baseline obligations. A contract
slice combining B02's missing priority, nullable due date and empty ordered
tags defaults on the same keyed legacy collection, post-version 4 and a typed
population count reaches the unchanged R5.16 `typed` checker and rejects the
second default as `UNSUPPORTED_LOWERING_CAPABILITY: overlapping collection
relations`. The focused rejection test and 160-test harness pass; this is a
**lowering halt**, not a passing B02 integration. See the
[R5.17 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_17-B02-GENERALIZATION-RETRY.md).

**Limit:** R5.15/R5.16 generated normalization, record outcomes, exact
insertion and *single-default* durable migration on unrelated domains, but no
B02 operation was generated or grounded. Frozen B02 acceptance and conformance
are N/A, not zero-pass observations. Task ordering/lifecycle/CLI binding remain
untested or unsupported in this path. No repair, new construct or B03 advance;
core 30 / historical raw 46, R5.2.2 historical authority, B17 unexposed and
unclassified, semantic-first format unfrozen. Application/compiler 31 OK;
R5.10–R5.17 focused 101 OK; whitespace checks clean with separate Git
LF→CRLF warnings. Universal correctness not established.

## R5.16 independent framed insertion and durable transition (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The checked exact-selection/full-record frame now generates a
fresh-key specimen registration over empty and populated durable collections.
A separate archive contract reads actual persisted V1/V2/unsupported versions,
defaults only missing fields in a uniquely keyed population, reports #30's
0/1/2 candidate cardinalities and persists V2. Independent public/file/event
grounding and semantic verification distinguish four insertion and six migration
fault variants; mutation of semantic field mapping/default changes generated
durable behavior. Trim and record-valued results compose without new lowering
branches. See the [R5.16 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_16-FRAMED-INSERTION-DURABLE-MIGRATION-LOWERING.md).

**Limit:** These are bounded one-frame/one-default collection transitions on
checked typed records, not arbitrary mixed relation synthesis, full CLI
binding, an acceptance result or universal implementation correctness.
Overlapping transforms reject; generated append is one valid storage-order
witness, not insertion ordering semantics. Result:
`R5_16_LOWERING_GAPS_CLOSED` for the two targeted capabilities only. Core 30,
historical raw 46, no B02 retry; Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed/unclassified,
R5.2.2 historical authority and semantic-first format unfrozen. Harness 159
OK, application/compiler 31 OK, focused final R5.16 4 OK; tracked diff check
passed with separate Git line-ending warnings.

## R5.15 independent general lowering (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** On independent media, device and library operations,
semantic-source mutations to ordered normalization, typed record field mapping
and keyed missing-field default alter real generated subprocess results or
durable state without compiler edits. A library operation composes all three;
a novel nested normalization/cardinality/device-state combination generates
without further edits. Internal events agree with public and durable observers;
a disposable wrong device replacement grounds but fails semantic conformance.
See the [R5.15 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_15-GENERAL-LOWERING-COVERAGE-EXPANSION.md).

**Limit:** Insertion remains unintegrated/unsupported; library edition is input
applicability, not a checked persisted version change. Bounded one-field
defaults do not establish full migration or all #44 compositions. The shared
typed AST/verifier still admits common-mode errors. Result:
`R5_15_GENERAL_LOWERING_PARTIAL`. Candidate core remains 30; historical raw
numbered inventory 46 with new unnumbered compiler/runtime/test machinery.
No generated B02 candidate or R5.15 B02 acceptance was run; historical v0.3
B02 gap unchanged. Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2
historically authoritative, semantic-first format unfrozen. Verification:
harness 155 OK, application/compiler 31 OK, validate/safety OK, diff check OK;
Git line-ending warnings separate from failures.

## R5.14 controlled B02 architecture pressure (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The frozen B02 repeated-tag, trim/nonblank, case-sensitive
first-occurrence and empty/migrated-default obligations can be expressed using
the existing prospective 30-candidate vocabulary. The R5.13 generator's
supported non-task slice does not emit map(trim), stable_unique, for_each or
keyed missing defaults; it also cannot build B02 insertion/versioned migration
and task-valued results. Halted at `GENERATIVE_LOWERING_CAPABILITY` before
candidate creation. See the [R5.14 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_14-B02-FROZEN-ARCHITECTURE-PRESSURE.md).

**Limit:** This is conceptual candidate-semantic expressibility across separate
prototypes, not a single integrated validated B02 model. No generated B02
acceptance, grounding or semantic-conformance result exists; demonstrated B02
executable reuse remains zero. The historical frozen v0.3 B02 language gap
remains unchanged. The result suggests better semantic coverage than compiler
coverage, not universal correctness or an architecture contradiction. Keep
30 core / 46 raw, semantic-first format unfrozen, Phase 5C paused after B02,
R5.2.2 historically authoritative, B17 unexposed/unclassified.
Verification: harness 149 OK (including architecture, grounding, prototypes
and R5.10–R5.13), application/compiler 31 OK; model validate and safety OK;
`git diff --check` passed. Four LF→CRLF warnings were separate from failures.

## R5.13 non-task generative lowering (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** Typed container contracts A–C generate disposable stateful
Python behavior: changing a selection literal or the referenced state field
changes real subprocess results and persisted bytes without compiler edits.
A fourth composition replaces a different field under a negated guard. The
external observer challenges events with independently captured stdout and
reopened state; an injected replacement-code fault remains grounded but fails
semantic conformance. Valid unsupported #44 relations reject explicitly,
type mismatches reject before execution, and repeated builds are byte-identical.
See the [R5.13 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_13-SEMANTIC-DRIVEN-GENERATIVE-LOWERING.md).

**Limit:** This is a constrained non-task state shape and string-result slice,
not B01 generation, arbitrary synthesis or universal correctness. The compiler
and verifier share typed AST infrastructure and can share bugs; endpoint
grounding cannot detect every intermediate effect. Representation verbosity and
AI-authoring cost are unmeasured. The recommended next experiment challenges
independent non-task state shapes and richer typed binding before any scaling.
At the R5.13 checkpoint Phase 5C was paused and B02 not yet resumed; B17
unexposed/unclassified, format unfrozen,
R5.2.2 historically authoritative, 30 candidate core / 46 raw unchanged.
Verification: benchmark harness 149 OK, application/compiler 31 OK; focused
architecture 6, grounding 10, semantic prototypes 33, R5.10 4, R5.11 4,
R5.12 3, R5.13 5 OK. `git diff --check` passed; four tracked LF→CRLF warnings
were separate from failures.

## R5.12 POC health review (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** R5.11 template generation substitutes metadata rather than
lowering semantic operation behavior. B01 command rules appear in both target
Python and its case checker; the operation label index supplies hashes, not
an authoritative typed contract. A small general typed validating lowerer now
handles the two B01 read-only success checks and a synthetic non-task typed
filter/order/cardinality contract. Mutating the latter's predicate reverses
which grounded-*shape* tuple conforms without modifying lowering code; a novel
valid keyed-default relation is explicitly unsupported. See the
[R5.12 gate](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_12-POC-HEALTH-GENERAL-LOWERING-GATE.md).

**Limit:** Synthetic tuples are not observed execution; target implementation
does not regenerate from changed typed contracts. No universal correctness or
per-program productivity comparison follows. Recommendation: generative
bounded #45 lowering and independent non-task challenge before scaling. R5.2.2
remains authoritative; Phase 5C paused; B17 unexposed/unclassified; 30 core
unchanged; semantic-first format unfrozen.

## R5.11 B01 instrumented integration (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** A separately generated B01-only CLI passes the unmodified
frozen B01 profile (5 passes, 2 B02 skips). Generated internal events on real
subprocess calls match independent public output and reopened persisted state;
the observed create, normal list, exact-HIGH list, completion and migration
cases are grounded and conformant. A three-record v2 migration preserves all
three existing priorities and reports 3 via #30 cardinality. A disposable
wrong-count variant is grounded/nonconformant, while a false post-state report
fails grounding before conformance. See the [R5.11 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_11-B01-INSTRUMENTED-INTEGRATION.md).

**Limit:** Abstract 30-candidate expressiveness and grounded finite cases do
not prove universal implementation correctness or a generally checked typed
#45 lowering. File endpoint checks do not expose every intermediate write.
The historical executable is unchanged; R5.2.2 remains authoritative,
Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed and the semantic-first format unfrozen.

## R5.10 migration count expressiveness (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** Frozen v2 B01 migration counts all three converted records,
not records lacking priority. The existing relations select and preserve an
arbitrary legacy population but cannot equate its extent to the reported
integer. A general typed cardinality relation (#30) plus exact selection and
a synthetic transition accepts supplied populations of size 0, 1, 4, 17 and
rejects wrong counts. A filtered three-row witness counts only its two
candidates. See the [R5.10 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_10-MIGRATION-COUNT-EXPRESSIVENESS.md).

**Limit:** These are synthetic semantic witnesses, not integrated versioned
B01 contracts or execution. Prospective count is 46 raw / 30 candidate core;
historical inventory stays at 45. The pinned B01 executable still lacks the
R5.7 internal per-operation event. B01 inadequate and halted, Phase 5C paused,
B17 unexposed/unclassified, R5.2.2 authoritative and format unfrozen.

## R5.9 B01 complete-contract restart (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** Frozen B01 plus inherited baseline require a numeric migration
count for arbitrary legacy populations. Exact selection, ordering, projection
and equality suggest insertion and completion framing without a new command
primitive, but the currently integrated #45 checker cannot evaluate that
composition. The pinned B01 Lykoi snapshot passed five frozen acceptance
methods, and independent public/file endpoint capture covered seven selected
root calls, a completion failure and v1 migration. The snapshot emits no
per-operation internal event to challenge, so B01 grounding fails and #45
case conformance is not evaluated. See the [R5.9 evidence](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_9-B01-END-TO-END-ADEQUACY-RESTART.md).

**Limit:** Numeric count/cardinality is a provisional core expressiveness gap;
full typing, migration metadata and checked B01 interface/provenance are separate
blockers. CRITICAL's independent ordinal behavior is underspecified, not grounds
for priority sorting. No #30 was added (45 historical raw, 29 candidate core).
R5.2.2 remains authoritative; B01 halted, Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed and
unclassified and the semantic-first format unfrozen.

## R5.8 conditional outcome expressiveness (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Implemented observation:** A generalized #45 abstract contract composes
typed outcome tags, conjunction/complement and equality/state relations for
the synthetic R5.7 operation. Grounded correct failure and success conform;
an incorrect failure classification or changed durable state reaches semantic
non-conformance without the earlier adapter policy. See the
[R5.8 analysis](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_8-CONDITIONAL-OUTCOME-EXPRESSIVENESS.md).

**Limit:** This is one common payload type and one observed state view; it does
not prove variant-specific payload typing, no attempted write, byte-level
equivalence for all stores, or general conformance. The 29 candidate core and
45 historical raw counts do not change. B01 remains inadequate and halted;
R5.2.2 authoritative, Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed and unclassified,
semantic-first format unfrozen.

## R5.7 case-scoped grounding experiment (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Implemented observation:** A generated synthetic vial-sealing operation was
called in isolated subprocesses; external argument/output capture and raw
durable-file readback challenged internal invocation events and checked artifact
provenance. Wrong result/state and error-path writes produced grounded
non-conformance; fabricated input/post reports and stale artifacts were rejected
before conformance. The [R5.7 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_7-GROUNDING-PROTOTYPE.md)
contains the fault matrix, trust boundary, verification and construct ledger.

**Limit:** R5.5 equality/default relations do not express conditional typed
failure classification. An adapter policy handles the selected case without
enlarging the 29 candidate core constructs; this makes the prototype partial,
not a B01 adequacy finding. The 45 historical numbered entries remain unchanged;
12 new non-semantic implementation responsibilities are inventoried separately.
B01 remains inadequate and halted; R5.2.2 authoritative, Phase 5C paused,
B17 unexposed and unclassified, semantic-first format unfrozen.

## R5.6 grounding and trust model (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Code observation:** The R5.5 record checks a self-reported `source` and an
opaque boundary string, while the current generated manifest pins one artifact
with all model IDs, not a public-entry-to-contract map. The independent scenario
probe can read file bytes around selected subprocess calls but does not create
generic same-invocation contract records. The runtime's one-file `os.replace`
does not imply cross-resource atomicity or crash durability.

**Assessment:** Compiler ownership can normalize operation and persistence
boundaries, attach specific provenance and route declared effects, but compiler
hooks alone risk circular trust. Independent argv/outcome capture and post-call
durable readback can challenge reported facts on scoped cases. This is a
ready-to-prototype recommendation with explicit unknown-effect/concurrency
limits, not an implemented grounding path or universal claim. No prototype or
new construct was needed for this architecture decision; counts remain 45 raw
and 29 candidate core. The [R5.6 record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_6-GROUNDING-TRUST-MODEL.md)
contains the boundary and assurance analysis. B01 remains inadequate and
halted, R5.2.2 authoritative, Phase 5C paused, B17 unexposed and unclassified,
and the semantic-first format unfrozen.

## R5.5 semantic architecture separation (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Implemented observation:** The historical seven synthetic #45 tuple checks
now delegate to an extracted abstract contract evaluator. Separate validators
reject implementation fields in contracts, behavioral checks in binding,
and requirements or proof labels in concrete records. The case verifier
reports `proof_status: not_established` even when the relation holds; trace
continuity validates equal adjacent state on one declared boundary. Six new
architecture tests exercise these responsibilities, not B01 behavior.

**Limit:** The slot map and execution records are not yet a faithful adapter
to actual public calls or durable state. The selected subprocess scenario
probe is unchanged and not wired to the new verifier. This is an architectural
partial result, not a semantic capability gain, acceptance freeze or proof.
The [R5.5 result](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_5-SEMANTIC-ARCHITECTURE-SEPARATION.md)
contains the 45-entry responsibility accounting and AI-native review. B01
remains inadequate and halted; R5.2.2, the Phase 5C pause and B17 boundary
remain in force.

## R5.4 semantic architecture checkpoint (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The seven #45 synthetic tuples test a supplied relation,
whereas the selected R5.4 CLI scenarios observe real executions; no checked
mapping joins their input/pre/outcome/post slots across all public calls. The
raw 45 prototype entries include ten observation/evidence and six benchmark
administration constructs, leaving 29 provisional candidate core constructs
when #45 is limited to its abstract operation relation. This does not establish
minimality, integration or B01 adequacy.

**Assessment:** The grounding gap mainly spans interface metadata, lowering,
observation and verification; universal implementation correctness requires a
separate proof argument. A typed operation relation is plausible semantic
source, but conflating it with actual-execution binding requires architectural
revision before B01 work continues. The
[checkpoint](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-SEMANTIC-ARCHITECTURE-CHECKPOINT.md)
records alternatives, finite-evidence limits and exposed-clause reuse. R5.2.2
remains authoritative; B01 is halted and inadequate, the format unfrozen,
Phase 5C paused, and B17 unexposed and unclassified.

## B01 operation-contract adequacy investigation (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** Existing relations constrain supplied collections but not
every actual public invocation and persistent before/after state. A single
typed operation binding is a plausible common interface; seven synthetic
fixtures for an arbitrary operation distinguish result/state/source failures
and two correct populations using equality and keyed missing defaults. They
are finite witnesses, not application or universal contract verification.

**Halt:** Public observation grounding and universal state/invocation scope
remain unimplemented; keyed creation/update framing and migration outcome
semantics are also open. “Above HIGH” has no specified observable rank
comparison and does not imply priority-sorted lists. B01 is inadequate; the
prototype ledger now has 45 constructs. See the
[operation-contract halt](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-B01-OPERATION-CONTRACT-ADEQUACY-HALT.md).

## Phase 5C exact-selection restart (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Prototype observation:** A typed exact selection relation now checks
soundness, completeness, multiplicity and source-relative order for finite
ordered sources; B01 equality and B03 case-sensitive membership compose from
the same construct. Thirteen positive/negative fixture cases and extra
counterexamples exercise it, not universal truth or application acceptance.
The [ledger](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-SELECTION-VOCABULARY-LEDGER.md)
counts 42 implemented prototype constructs, 28 reused across frozen clauses.

**Halt:** B01's arbitrary-task priority preservation/default through migration
still lacks a general state-field transition/frame rule; its normal sorted
query order also lacks a typed universal binding. No further clause gate was
passed. Temporal/graph selection predicates and cross-document clause
composition are not implemented. See the
[restart record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-SELECTION-ADEQUACY-RESTART-HALT.md).

## Phase 5C invariant vocabulary restart (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Prototype:** Typed universal transition rules over arbitrary finite string
sequences and directed graphs now compose trim, stable case-sensitive
first-occurrence uniqueness, proposed edge addition and acyclicity. Schema
validation checks types, bindings, relationships and witness links. Twelve
linked semantic cases exercise the collection and graph rules; this is not
application acceptance or universal proof. The separate B14 self-error and
other B02/B14 clauses remain to be represented and bridged.

**Observation/halt:** Re-screening frozen B01–B16 text from B01 found B01's
general exact-HIGH selection cannot be faithfully stated by this bounded
vocabulary; B03's tag-membership selection and normal ordering are independent
instances of the same gap. The
[restart record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-INVARIANT-PROTOTYPE-ADEQUACY-RESTART-HALT.md)
classifies clause groups and inventories every primitive and remaining gap.
No schema freeze, R5.2.2 replacement, B17 exposure or B17 classification
follows from these fixtures.

## Phase 5C clock binding and format restart (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Implementation/witness:** A disposable subprocess adapter binds one explicit
UTC instant before loading the Python application. A focused fixture on the
pinned Conventional post-B16 executable checks strict before/equal/after,
application creation timestamp equality, repeated execution and missing or
mismatched binding rejection. This does not revalidate the frozen suites.

**Observation/halt:** Screening frozen B01–B16 text after the clock fix found
that finite equality/distinctness/time scenarios cannot state B02's rule for
arbitrary numbers of trimmed, ordered, case-sensitive unique tags; B14's
general cycle condition is another challenge. The
[adequacy restart record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-SEMANTIC-ADEQUACY-RESTART-HALT.md)
documents the source-level inventory and stops before schema freeze or B17
composition. A general rule vocabulary remains a proposal, not a demonstrated
solution.

## Phase 5C B17 partial-dependency adjudication (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Decision:** Phase 5C still measures complete requests. If the frozen track
lacks B16, B17 as a whole is `BLOCKED_BY_GAP -> B16`; missing-actor rejection
can be independently observed without becoming partial B17 achievement. Record
such observations with separate diagnostic vocabulary and restored/disposable
state; no B17 replacement or achieved history is activated. Conventional must
meet the full B17 requirement on its B16 continuation. The
[adjudication record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-B17-PARTIAL-DEPENDENCY-ADJUDICATION.md)
sets the rule, not a B17 outcome. Clause-ID inventory, clock adapter, bounded
bridge and checkpoint revalidation remain open before B17 exposure.

## Phase 5C typed-clock and B17 dependency review (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Prototype:** A named `utc_now` binding with typed UTC instants, offsets and
strict-before comparison passes controlled-clock fixture checks for before,
equal and after; checked semantic-root and dependency composition passes
synthetic fail-closed fixtures. The subprocess probe correctly refuses to
claim a clock-dependent application witness without an application clock
adapter. Neither mechanism is a frozen clause-to-carrier bridge.

**Frozen-text assessment (prior halt):** B17's missing-actor rejection and existing task
read exemption can be observed without B16, while roles, existing actors and
owner-based permissions require B16's persistent users/ownership. The
request-level historical blocked-by-gap protocol did not explicitly settle
how to observe independently testable dimensions of a partly dependent but
blocked request. The analysis and original stop are in the
[halt record](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-B17-PARTIAL-DEPENDENCY-ADJUDICATION-HALT.md);
the separate adjudication above resolves that question without exposing B17.

## Phase 5C bounded-bridge format gate (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** The Part 1 adequacy review stopped before schema freeze.
The prototype's literal/reference expressions cannot specify a due timestamp
relative to current UTC time, required by the frozen B12 clause and its active
historical boundary carrier. Its unchecked lineage strings also do not express
validated requirement-level dependencies or replacement targets; the B17
draft's B16 guard leaves hypothetical early-history B17 without a scenario.
Details and source locations are in
[`R5_4-SEMANTIC-FORMAT-ADEQUACY-HALT.md`](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-SEMANTIC-FORMAT-ADEQUACY-HALT.md).
These are format/composition gaps, not evidence of a language capability gap
or of an incorrect R5.2.2 oracle. B17 remains unexposed and unfrozen.

## Phase 5C semantic-requirement prototype (prospective, 2026-10-02)

**Observation:** R5.3's saved 233/28 candidate sites are not a certified
assertion-level semantic inventory; its latest worksheet still has 187/21
unexplained candidates. The corrected B01 case shows why precondition fidelity
matters: a HIGH-only witness misses the pending NORMAL task present when the
original `list-high` assertion ran. The R5.2.2 corrected parent remains the
authoritative historical acceptance boundary.

**Prototype result:** A small JSON scenario vocabulary describes ordered
commands, achieved-history guards, storage snapshots, data bindings and
observations. Selected B01/B11/B14/B16 witnesses execute successfully on a
pinned Conventional B16 snapshot (five scenarios); the early B01 variant
executes on a pinned Lykoi {B01,B04} snapshot (one scenario). The prototype
validator also rejects overlapping variants and unbound references. These are
examples and diagnostic checks, not exhaustive requirement coverage, restored
full-suite revalidation, or a new frozen oracle. B17 semantic records have
been drafted but neither derived acceptance nor protocol freeze exists.

**Research implication:** Semantic-first authoring may avoid reconstructing
every Python helper path for new requests, provided targeted historical
carrier retention is independently checked. Whether it actually reduces
effort or errors compared with B11–B16 remains an untested hypothesis; collect
comparable per-request effort and corrections at B17–B20.

## Phase 2 baseline and priority experiment (2026-10-01)

Baseline: `experiments/task_manager-v0.1.json` is the original Phase 1 model.
`experiments/task_manager-v0.2-before-priority.json` retains its application
behavior but expresses it in v0.2 for an application-only semantic comparison.
Both baseline and final models validate. The final model is
`air/task_manager.json`.

### Observation: finding the impact of a field addition

**Conventional Approach:** Search for task constructors, readers, persistence,
interfaces and tests, then inspect likely matches.

**Lykoi Approach:** `inspect field_priority` finds its type, the creating
behavior, filtered reader, migration and owner by semantic IDs. Diffing the
v0.2 baseline against the final model identifies the new `type_priority`,
`field_priority`, `arg_priority`, `fn_list_high`, `cmd_list_high`, `cmd_migrate`, contracts and
`migration_task_priority`. `fn_create` assigns the field and consumes the
new input; `fn_list_high` filters on it; `cmd_create` binds the input. The
`type_task` change reaches `fn_complete` and `fn_delete` through their output
type, and `state_tasks` reaches all four existing behaviors via state
relationships. `fn_list`, `fn_complete` and `fn_delete` also acquire a
`migration_required` failure because their state now has schema version 2.

**Result:** Explicit references made direct impact easier to discover. The
initial v0.1-to-v0.2 diff was noisy because identity was added to contracts
and errors and effect categories changed; a normalized v0.2 baseline is
necessary to isolate the application change. The current impact calculation
reports immediate semantic dependents, not a complete transitive execution
path; some affected entities are conservatively flagged.

**Implication:** Machine-queryable relationships help, but changes to the
*language representation* must be distinguished from changes to application
behavior in research comparisons.

### Observation: default and HIGH-only selection

**Conventional Approach:** Add a field to a Python record, a default in the
constructor, a new CLI flag and a filtered-list code path.

**Lykoi Approach:** A typed enum, `input_default` assignment and
`field_equals` collection predicate represent the requested semantics in the
model. Validation checks enum literals, typed assignments, command bindings,
predicate field references and inferred effect footprints. The generated
Python was never manually edited.

**Result:** Validation and all 17 tests pass. An isolated execution created
a NORMAL task and a HIGH task; `list-high` returned exactly the HIGH task and
`list` returned both. There was a language capability gap: Phase 1 could
neither bind an optional input with a default nor select a subset of a
collection. The smallest reusable extensions were a typed input default and
a typed equality predicate. Both are backend-independent and enable new
validation. They required changes to the validator and Python backend; this
upfront compiler work is more expensive than the corresponding short Python
edit for a single small app.

**Implication:** Explicit semantics may pay off across repeated maintenance
tasks, but this first experiment does not demonstrate a net speed advantage.

### Observation: existing persisted tasks

**Conventional Approach:** Write a migration script or opportunistically
default missing fields during reads; review failures manually.

**Lykoi Approach:** `migration_task_priority` declares a schema transition,
constant field addition and read/write effects. An old file makes ordinary
commands report `migration_required`. `migrate` checks the resulting record
shape and invariants before atomic replacement; repeated invocation is a
no-op.

**Result:** Integration tests show legacy data remains untouched until
migration, then receives NORMAL priority. This surfaced a second capability
gap: the Phase 1 persistence format had no schema version. v0.2 introduces an
explicit versioned envelope and a narrow additive migration. The current
migration model does not support transformations, deletions, multi-state
coordination, or proving old-record invariants independently of the final
schema; those would need new general-purpose semantics before use.

**Implication:** Storage compatibility is part of semantic modification, not
merely a generated-code detail. Explicit migrations make it visible but add
representation and runtime complexity.

### Observation: provenance and reproducibility

**Conventional Approach:** Associate a commit and build output by filename.

**Lykoi Approach:** The generated header directs edits back to Lykoi. The
manifest records model/compiler versions, the artifact hash and semantic
entity IDs. Inspection/diff uses the model rather than the generated source.

**Result:** Regeneration is deterministic and the compiler test compares the
generated file byte-for-byte. The manifest currently associates the one
self-contained artifact with all semantic entities; it cannot attribute a
particular generated line to one behavior. The experiment's generated artifact
SHA-256 is `db19c077abd7b9177e1092ad38edb3479720e1f60bc1e8ac90ece0b37d1f9afd`.

**Implication:** Artifact-level provenance is useful now; finer attribution
requires a more granular lowering pipeline, not a claim of behavioral proof.

## Capability-gap decisions

| Missing concept | Why Phase 1 was insufficient | Smallest reusable addition | Backend-independent? | New validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Optional priority input | Only required CLI inputs and unconditional assignments existed. | Typed `input_default` binding; omission selects a literal default. | Yes; CLI flags are only one boundary binding. | Input type matches field, default belongs to enum, optional argument has a default. |
| HIGH-only list | `list` could only return the entire collection. | Typed collection selection with `field_equals` before sorting. | Yes. | Predicate field exists and its literal matches the field type. |
| Existing persisted tasks | Phase 1 had no schema version or migration operation. | Identified additive state migration with declared read/write effects and an explicit command. | Semantic transition yes; the JSON envelope and atomic replacement are backend details. | Version chain, target field and default type, complete effect declaration, final-state invariants. |

## Phase 3: plan-first due-date experiment (2026-10-01)

The original model hash is `f57f6b8661db24fad4de119875454638008f6a24`
(Git blob SHA-1). Before changing `air/task_manager.json`, I wrote
`experiments/phase3-due-dates.plan.json`, validated its typed operations and
saved explained paths in `experiments/phase3-prechange-impact.json`. `plan`
reported direct-dependent omissions for five unchanged postconditions and
`inv_unique_ids`; these were kept as warnings instead of being silently
folded into an edit list. The first `apply` generated and verified a staged
change, but one negative plan-validator test failed: after rejecting removal
of the state, the reporter still tried to index the invalid candidate. Apply
restored the original model and artifacts; fixing the reporter made the
second apply pass all 22 tests; the final suite, including a later stale-plan
regression and provenance check, passes all 24 tests. No generated Python was
read to plan impact.

Actual semantic operations are recorded in `experiments/phase3-actual-diff.json`;
the ID comparison is in `experiments/phase3-impact-comparison.json`:
16 expected-and-changed, 12 expected-but-unchanged, zero unexpectedly
changed. The unchanged IDs include all old list/update/delete behaviors,
their commands, the old migration, the storage and clock capabilities and
the task list type. They are affected *conceptually* via the new record
shape/state version but require no semantic edit. This is evidence of
conservative reachability, not a precision score. It is partly tautological:
the plan specifies concrete transformations, so comparing its predicted
change IDs to its own resulting structural diff cannot establish that the
original human intent was inferred correctly.

1. **Could affected entities be found from relationships alone?** Yes for
   the record, constructors, readers, persisted state, commands, constraints,
   migration, and declared capabilities. `type_task → type_task_list →
   state_tasks → fn_list → cmd_list` is an inspectable pre-change path. The
   manifest points to a single artifact containing all entities and cannot
   locate an affected generated region. Pre-existing Python tests have no
   model relationship; the new fixed-clock scenario is model-owned.
2. **Missing dependencies?** Nullable field shape, composed predicates,
   clock-dependent selection, and executable example expectations were
   missing concepts, not missing edges. A new `field_before_clock` predicate
   adds an explicit dependency on `cap_clock`; its `clock_read` effect is
   inferred and checked. The pre-existing migration command referenced one
   migration, so supporting a second version required treating that binding
   as the latest migration in a chain.
3. **Excess irrelevant results?** Yes. Type/state reachability includes
   commands and postconditions that did not change. Paths are useful for
   inspection, but the current direct/indirect labels describe graph distance,
   not likelihood of needing modification. Missing direct dependents were
   warnings rather than proof of plan incompleteness.
4. **Did planning catch mistakes?** It identified omitted direct dependents
   before application and rejected invalid plans in tests (dangling state
   removal and empty behavioral verification). It did not predict the
   reporter bug: that surfaced during apply verification. Verification strings
   are declared evidence goals, not formally linked to test IDs or proven to
   have been covered by the runner.
5. **Did clock access help?** Yes. The overdue behavior declares `cap_clock`
   and `clock_read`. Removing the effect fails validation. A fixed-clock
   scenario checks past/future/equal/undated/completed records without
   depending on wall-clock timing, and asserts one clock sample per query.
   The public CLI still reads the real system clock through that capability.
6. **Where is Lykoi still structural conventional code?** The backend is a
   Python interpreter for narrowly structured CRUD and filter instructions;
   the plan's append/set operations manipulate JSON arrays and fields. The
   scenario test imports the generated module, and artifact-level provenance
   remains broad. The bounded semantics give deterministic validation, but
   neither the plan nor its contracts express arbitrary temporal logic or
   guarantee that a verification sentence corresponds to an executed test.

The migration from state version 2 to 3 adds `due_date: null` to old records;
version 1 migration chains through the earlier priority migration. Normal
reads reject unmigrated state. Strictly earlier UTC instants qualify as
overdue, and complete or undated tasks do not. These observations were made
from the model and tests, with compiler template work following the plan.

## Phase 4: lifecycle, authority, semantic safety (2026-10-01)

The v0.3 Task model gives its status lifecycle and `pending → completed`
transition stable IDs. `fn_complete` must perform that transition and match
its target and source guard. Mutating status without the transition, changing
the target, and removing the source guard are rejected during validation,
before generating Python. A generated-runtime scenario completes a pending
record, then verifies that repeating the transition fails without altering
the file.

Storage read and write authority are separately identified and granted to
each behavior/migration. Removing required write authority or adding write
authority to the overdue reader fails validation; effects alone do not confer
permission. This is model-level authority, not an OS-level sandbox.

The safety report classifies the stored-record invariants as runtime enforced
and the completed-record exclusion from the overdue query as structurally
guaranteed by its validated equality filter. It does not count passing tests
as formal proof. The model has six declared invariants and one transition;
the verification suite now runs 31 tests. Phase 3's 16/12/0 comparison remains
a conservative reachability observation, not an accuracy or safety score.

## Phase 5C: executable-path observation (2026-10-02)

The prospective R5.3 reconstruction revealed a measurement distinction:
source sites indicate possible assertions, while a runtime trace supplies
concrete invocations, operands and reached paths. Two frozen R5.2.2 achieved
histories produced repeatable normalized external-suite traces, but a same-line
event/root correlation alone cannot demonstrate that the reconstructed root
preserves the CLI input, returned value, later persisted observation and
rejection precondition. Generated IDs and creation times require relational
aliases rather than removal; B12's wall-clock-relative deadline additionally
requires recording its *source-derived* relative-time rule. An initial
in-process rerun also exposed frozen skip-marker mutation of the baseline
test class; restoring those methods after execution made repetition possible
without changing the frozen runner. The evidence and open reconciliation gates
are recorded in [R5.3 runtime-trace progress](../benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_3-RUNTIME-TRACE-VALIDATION-PROGRESS.md).

This supports using static and dynamic evidence together, not treating the
dynamic trace as a new semantic authority. No completeness or equivalence
claim follows while executable paths remain unmapped.
# Prospective B01 semantic-format restart (2026-10-02)

Reading the frozen B01 request against the inherited baseline and corrected
R5.2.2 carrier shows two distinguishable collection relations: ascending
`(created_at, id)` exact result order, and keyed field-preserving migration
with NORMAL applied only when priority is absent. The unfrozen
`benchmark/semantic/state_relations.py` prototypes both and checks finite
positive/negative witnesses. It does not bind those collections to arbitrary
public command traces or persisted states, nor settle the observable meaning
of the priority rank. B01 adequacy remains halted; details and limitations are
in `benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_4-B01-ORDER-TRANSITION-ADEQUACY-HALT.md`.

## R5.23 comprehensive B02 integration-retry observations (prospective, 2026-10-03)

The first comprehensive B02 retry after closing the known lowering-coverage
backlog relation-by-relation reached a new integration first — a twelve-branch
multi-command B02-shaped semantic program typed, rendered and executed as one
generated program, with create-success (typed external identity and clock,
fallback defaults, framed insertion, embedded tag normalization) grounded and
semantically conformant under both controlled and real providers. Thirteen of
thirteen executable B02-shaped operations grounded with byte-level no-write
obligations honored on every failure and read. Yet the *complete* document still
halted at typed validation, and the failures were not of the kind the backlog
could enumerate: independently validated capabilities collided where they share
one representation domain. `instant` creation timestamps (required by the clock
capability) are rejected as ordering keys, while orderable string columns reject
the clock; `before`/`equals` bind neither optional nor nullable record fields, so
faithful overdue selection and legacy-row filters cannot guard; the grammar has
no suppliedness or domain-well-formedness relation, so `invalid_due_date` and
read-time `invalid_state` have no typed failure branch; one contract admits one
state shape, so v2/v3-versus-v4 row typing and bare-list-to-envelope promotion
cannot coexist with current reads. The deferred frozen-transport binding
(positional argv, repeated flags, shared store, missing-file semantics, error
envelope and exit codes) was separately observed absent — as expected, and never
secretly substituted.

The measurement lesson: "no known required relation remains unsupported" held
per relation while being false per program. The "Integrated AST / CLI binding"
coverage row was closed from a single-operation probe while the multi-operation
document was excluded from the backlog as assembly, leaving the composition
pressure uncategorized. Coverage enumeration must track *shared domains*
(field type junctions, optional/nullable operand rules, storage-shape versioning,
contract arity, transport contracts), not relation kinds alone. Slice
grounding/conformance remains non-substitutable for whole-program generation;
no frozen acceptance ran, and no repair occurred after lock. No semantic
construct was added: the candidate core count remains 30 with no #31; every
observed blocker references existing semantics (#24/#25, #27, #43, #44, #45, #30)
at the lowering/type-integration/binding layer. Details and the exact gate are in
`benchmark/results/phase5c/R5_23-B02-COMPREHENSIVE-INTEGRATION-RETRY.md`.
